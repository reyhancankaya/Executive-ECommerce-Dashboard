# E-Commerce Strategic Performance Review: 2025 Strategy Brief

## Project Goal

This Tableau Workbook was created to inform the company's 2025 e-commerce strategy.The primary goal is to analyze historical sales data (2014–2017) to identify key risk factors, geographic weaknesses and product category issues that are actively **eroding** the company's profit margin.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed three critical areas requiring immediate executive action:

1.  **Profitability Erosion:** Despite overall company growth, the **Furniture** category generates the highest loss per sale and is actively dragging down the overall profit margin.
2.  **High Geographic Risk:** The **West Region**, while being the largest market by volume, represents the most volatile and high-risk area in terms of profitability. California specifically has high sales but persistent margin problems.
3.  **High-Risk Inventory:** The dynamic Top N/Bottom N analysis highlights high-volume successes (e.g., **Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier**) while instantly flagging **low-profit velocity items** (Profit Drain) such as the **Eureka Disposable Bags for  Saniatere Vibra**, which need to be addressed immediately.

## Tableau Interface Overview

The report is structured into two main navigation tabs:

1.  **`Executive Performance Dashboard`:** The central, filterable tool where all key metrics and geographic risks are consolidated. Managers can use the **`Top N`** parameter to instantly identify the highest profit-generating or highest loss-generating products.
2.  **`E-Commerce Strategy Review` (Story):** This tab provides a guided presentation flow, summarizing all major findings (Trends, Risks, and Action Areas) for executive review.
